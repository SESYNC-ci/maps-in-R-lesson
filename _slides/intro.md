This lesson presents different methods available to visualize spatial data
in R. All types of spatial data belong in one of two main categories: 
*vectors* (points, lines and polygons) or *rasters* (grids of pixels).

### Comparing raster and vector data

| Raster     | Vector     |
|------------+------------|
| matrix     | table      |
| surface    | shape      |
| pixels     | features   |
| bands      | attributes |
